    "- For this challenge, I opted to use sql to create the required table. \n",
    "- To get the top 5 members, I paid attention to the memid column and bookid column. The data was extracted from the bookings table. \n",
    "- I assumed for each row in the memid column where the value is not 0 that indicates a member, which would mean that all memid's referred to as 0 are non-members under this assumption.\n",
    "- So each row that isn't 0 is counted as a member and for the transformation, I counted the bookid amd renamed it as \"Booking Count\". \n",
    "- This then gives me a table with Memid and Booking count. \n",
    "- This is ordered using the DESC statement so I can see the highest count first. \n",
    "- To see the Top 5, I use the limit statement to \"limit 5\""
